This is the companion repository for the upcoming book [Python for Excel](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-excel/9781492080992/).


**NOTE**: This is currently work-in-progress and will continuously be updated/changed until the final release of the book. 

The notebooks from chapters 1-5 can be run in the cloud: click on the `Binder` logo to run them - it's free and you don't need to install anything, but you can't save anything permanently.
